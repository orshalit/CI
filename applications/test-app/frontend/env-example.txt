# =============================================================================
# Frontend Environment Variables (Vite)
# =============================================================================
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in the values for your environment.
# Variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be exposed to the frontend.
#
# Usage:
#   cp env-example.txt .env.local
#   # Edit .env.local with your values

# Backend API URL (Build-time variable for Vite)
# This is baked into the React build at build time.
# For production ECS deployments, this should be set during the Docker build.
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Note: There is also BACKEND_API_URL (runtime variable) used by nginx
# for Content Security Policy configuration. That is set in the ECS task definition,
# not in this file. See services/frontend.yaml for runtime configuration.
